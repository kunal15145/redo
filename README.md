# redo
1. Ever copied github url, pasted on terminal and it failed. Well duhhh! It does not contain `git clone`.
   Install this package to redo that pasted github url command with `git clone $git_url`
2. Retries last failed command with sudo

Package assumes you have already started using fish

```fish
$ cd redo; and ./install.sh
